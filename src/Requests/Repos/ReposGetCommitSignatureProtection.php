 * When authenticated with admin or owner permissions to the repository, you can
 * use this endpoint to check whether a branch requires signed commits. An enabled status of `true`
 * indicates you must sign commits on this branch. For more information, see [Signing commits with
 * GPG](https://docs.github.com/articles/signing-commits-with-gpg) in GitHub Help.

 * > [!NOTE]
