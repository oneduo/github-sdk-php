/**
 * code-scanning/delete-analysis
 *
 * Deletes a specified code scanning analysis from a repository.
 *
 * You can delete one analysis at a
 * time.
 * To delete a series of analyses, start with the most recent analysis and work
 * backwards.
 * Conceptually, the process is similar to the undo function in a text editor.
 *
 * When you
 * list the analyses for a repository,
 * one or more will be identified as deletable in the
 * response:
 *
 * ```
 * "deletable": true
 * ```
 *
 * An analysis is deletable when it's the most recent in a set of
 * analyses.
 * Typically, a repository will have multiple sets of analyses
 * for each enabled code scanning
 * tool,
 * where a set is determined by a unique combination of analysis values:
 *
 * * `ref`
 * * `tool`
 * *
 * `category`
 *
 * If you attempt to delete an analysis that is not the most recent in a set,
 * you'll get a
 * 400 response with the message:
 *
 * ```
 * Analysis specified is not deletable.
 * ```
 *
 * The response from a
 * successful `DELETE` operation provides you with
 * two alternative URLs for deleting the next analysis
 * in the set:
 * `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`.
 * Use the `next_analysis_url` URL if you
 * want to avoid accidentally deleting the final analysis
 * in a set. This is a useful option if you want
 * to preserve at least one analysis
 * for the specified tool in your repository.
 * Use the
 * `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove all analyses for a tool.
 * When you delete the
 * last analysis in a set, the value of `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`
 * in the 200
 * response is `null`.
 *
 * As an example of the deletion process,
 * let's imagine that you added a workflow
 * that configured a particular code scanning tool
 * to analyze the code in a repository. This tool has
 * added 15 analyses:
 * 10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.
 * You therefore have two
 * separate sets of analyses for this tool.
 * You've now decided that you want to remove all of the
 * analyses for the tool.
 * To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.
 * To start, you must
 * find an analysis that's identified as deletable.
 * Each set of analyses always has one that's
 * identified as deletable.
 * Having found the deletable analysis for one of the two sets,
 * delete this
 * analysis and then continue deleting the next analysis in the set until they're all deleted.
 * Then
 * repeat the process for the second set.
 * The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:
 *
 * **Outer
 * loop**:
 * * List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.
 * * Parse this list to find a
 * deletable analysis. If found:
 *
 *   **Inner loop**:
 *   * Delete the identified analysis.
 *   * Parse the
 * response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.
 *
 * The
 * above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool's analyses from the GitHub user
 * interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value.
 * Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would leave the last analysis in
 * each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's analysis entirely.
 *
 * OAuth app tokens and personal
 * access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint with private or public
 * repositories, or the `public_repo` scope to use this endpoint with only public repositories.
