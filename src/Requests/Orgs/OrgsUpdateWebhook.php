 * Updates a webhook configured in an organization. When you update a webhook,

 * overwritten. If you previously had a `secret` set, you must
 * provide the same `secret` or set a new
 * `secret` or the secret will be removed. If
 * you are only updating individual webhook `config`
 * properties, use "[Update a webhook
 * configuration for an
 * organization](/rest/orgs/webhooks#update-a-webhook-configuration-for-an-organization)".
 *
 * You must be
 * an organization owner to use this endpoint.
 *
 * OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic)
 * need `admin:org_hook` scope. OAuth apps cannot list, view, or edit
 * webhooks that they did not create
 * and users cannot list, view, or edit webhooks that were created by OAuth apps.
