/**
 * pulls/create-review
 *
 * Creates a review on a specified pull request.
 *
 * This endpoint triggers
 * [notifications](https://docs.github.com/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications).
 * Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. For more
 * information, see "[Rate limits for the
 * API](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api#about-secondary-rate-limits)"
 * and "[Best practices for using the REST
 * API](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api)."
 *
 * Pull request
 * reviews created in the `PENDING` state are not submitted and therefore do not include the
 * `submitted_at` property in the response. To create a pending review for a pull request, leave the
 * `event` parameter blank. For more information about submitting a `PENDING` review, see "[Submit a
 * review for a pull
 * request](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/reviews#submit-a-review-for-a-pull-request)."
 *
 * >
 * [!NOTE]
 * > To comment on a specific line in a file, you need to first determine the position of that
 * line in the diff. To see a pull request diff, add the `application/vnd.github.v3.diff` media type to
 * the `Accept` header of a call to the [Get a pull
 * request](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls#get-a-pull-request) endpoint.
 *
 * The `position`
 * value equals the number of lines down from the first "@@" hunk header in the file you want to add a
 * comment. The line just below the "@@" line is position 1, the next line is position 2, and so on.
 * The position in the diff continues to increase through lines of whitespace and additional hunks
 * until the beginning of a new file.
 *
 * This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For
 * more information, see "[Media
 * types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."
 *
 * -
 * **`application/vnd.github-commitcomment.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will
 * include `body`. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
 * -
 * **`application/vnd.github-commitcomment.text+json`**: Returns a text only representation of the
 * markdown body. Response will include `body_text`.
 * -
 * **`application/vnd.github-commitcomment.html+json`**: Returns HTML rendered from the body's
 * markdown. Response will include `body_html`.
 * - **`application/vnd.github-commitcomment.full+json`**:
 * Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include `body`, `body_text`, and
 * `body_html`.
