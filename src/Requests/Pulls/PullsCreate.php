/**

 *
 * Draft pull requests are available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for
 * organizations, GitHub Pro, and legacy per-repository billing plans, and in public and private
 * repositories with GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's
 * products](https://docs.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub
 * Help documentation.
 *
 * To open or update a pull request in a public repository, you must have write
 * access to the head or the source branch. For organization-owned repositories, you must be a member
 * of the organization that owns the repository to open or update a pull request.
 *
 * This endpoint
 * triggers
 * [notifications](https://docs.github.com/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications).
 * Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. For more
 * information, see "[Rate limits for the
 * API](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api#about-secondary-rate-limits)"
 * and "[Best practices for using the REST
 * API](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api)."
 *
 * This endpoint
 * supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media
 * types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."
 *
 * -
 * **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include `body`.
 * This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
 * -
 * **`application/vnd.github.text+json`**: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body.
 * Response will include `body_text`.
 * - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns HTML rendered
 * from the body's markdown. Response will include `body_html`.
 * -
 * **`application/vnd.github.full+json`**: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will
 * include `body`, `body_text`, and `body_html`.
