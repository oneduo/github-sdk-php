     * @param  string  $ghsaId  If specified, only advisories with this GHSA (GitHub Security Advisory) identifier will be returned.
     * @param  string  $type  If specified, only advisories of this type will be returned. By default, a request with no other parameters defined will only return reviewed advisories that are not malware.
     * @param  string  $cveId  If specified, only advisories with this CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identifier will be returned.
     * @param  string  $ecosystem  If specified, only advisories for these ecosystems will be returned.
     * @param  string  $severity  If specified, only advisories with these severities will be returned.
     * @param  mixed  $cwes  If specified, only advisories with these Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) will be returned.
     *
     * Example: `cwes=79,284,22` or `cwes[]=79&cwes[]=284&cwes[]=22`
     * @param  bool  $isWithdrawn  Whether to only return advisories that have been withdrawn.
     * @param  mixed  $affects  If specified, only return advisories that affect any of `package` or `package@version`. A maximum of 1000 packages can be specified.
     *                          If the query parameter causes the URL to exceed the maximum URL length supported by your client, you must specify fewer packages.
     *
     * Example: `affects=package1,package2@1.0.0,package3@^2.0.0` or `affects[]=package1&affects[]=package2@1.0.0`
     * @param  string  $published  If specified, only return advisories that were published on a date or date range.
     *
     * For more information on the syntax of the date range, see "[Understanding the search syntax](https://docs.github.com/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax#query-for-dates)."
     * @param  string  $updated  If specified, only return advisories that were updated on a date or date range.
     *
     * For more information on the syntax of the date range, see "[Understanding the search syntax](https://docs.github.com/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax#query-for-dates)."

     *
     * For more information on the syntax of the date range, see "[Understanding the search syntax](https://docs.github.com/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax#query-for-dates)."
     * @param  string  $epssPercentage  If specified, only return advisories that have an EPSS percentage score that matches the provided value.
     *                                  The EPSS percentage represents the likelihood of a CVE being exploited.
     * @param  string  $epssPercentile  If specified, only return advisories that have an EPSS percentile score that matches the provided value.
     *                                  The EPSS percentile represents the relative rank of the CVE's likelihood of being exploited compared to other CVEs.
     * @param  string  $before  A cursor, as given in the [Link header](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api#using-link-headers). If specified, the query only searches for results before this cursor. For more information, see "[Using pagination in the REST API](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."
